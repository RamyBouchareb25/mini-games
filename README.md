## Introduction
This Flutter app is a simple front-end implementation of two classic games: Tic-Tac-Toe and Lights Out. It serves as an introduction to Flutter development and showcases the basics of building interactive games in Flutter.

## Games
### Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with "X" or "O" to win by having three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

### Lights Out
Lights Out is a grid-based puzzle game where the goal is to turn off all the lights on the grid. Tapping a light toggles its state along with the adjacent lights. The challenge is to find the correct sequence of taps to turn off all lights.
